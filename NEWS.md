### What did you do this week?

-Rachel: I worked through the DataCamp module Working with Web Data in R in regards to the first three chapters: Downloading Files and Using API Clients, Using httr to interact with APIs directly, Handling JSON and XML. I also looked through the USCIS.gov and tried to use the techniques taught in the DataCamp course. I found the company that hosts the data for the search for a doctor; however, have not figured if the public has access to the data in CSV format.

-Ru: I watched the first three DataCamp videos for Working with Web Data in R and learnt how to download files from the web, using API clients and interacting with APIs. I also briefly looked at the USCIS website and read briefly about selenium package our client advised us to use. I found that there is a similar package in R, and hopefully it will be efficient enough to use for our project.  We also got in touch with our contact and are will be having our first meeting this week through Zoom on Wednesday. 

-Maggie: I did a lot of background research on Brady violations before our topic changed. I also did a bit of research on malpractice as well as laws regarding immigration to the United States, and did a bit of self-teaching on web scraping and Github. I, along with everyone else, also planned a meeting with our contact at ProPublica.

### What is it that you're struggling with right now?

-Rachel: I am struggling to figure which coding language we will end up using for the data scraping. Our client, Sarah, provided us with a resource Selenium which works best in python but my coding strength is in R. In addition, it’s difficult to find the resources that are most applicable to our project rather than generalized Data scraping courses.


-Ru: I’m still looking for the best way to scrape data from the USCIS website (Python vs R) as the page is responsive and does not necessarily have different endpoints for the url. It looks like the preferred method might end up being Python, but as I am more familiar with R, I've been trying to look for other packages we can use in R that will be helpful.  

-Maggie: trying to find out the best way to find data in the USCIS.gov, so that it can be scraped in the best way possible. We are also currently still trying to determine how this project’s trajectory as we recently had to change topics.

### What are you planning to do next week?

-Rachel: Planning to work through the rest of the applicable DataCamp courses in regard to webscraping in HTML, since that appears to be the language the site is coded in, and begin to code some basic data scraping techniques. In addition, we need to figure out the best way to organize the data set for our code to eventual compile the data into our data set structure.

-Ru: Planning to start using the skills used in DataCamp to scrape data from the website. We are meeting the client on Wednesday to talk more about the project.  

-Maggie: more research on web scraping and how to best implement it, and trying to navigate the website from which we will be getting our data.
